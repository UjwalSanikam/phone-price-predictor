## 💡 Pro Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Accurate About Condition**
   - "Like New" = barely used
   - "Excellent" = good, minor wear
   - "Good" = normal use, visible wear
   - "Fair" = significant use, damage

2. **Battery Health Matters**
   - Get a battery test before selling
   - 90%+ = best price
   - <75% = significant discount
   - Every 5% matters

3. **Device Age is Important**
   - Count from purchase date
   - Each month ≈ 3.5% depreciation
   - 24+ months = significant impact
   - Newer always worth more

4. **Damage Level Impact**
   - None = baseline
   - Minor = -5%
   - Moderate = -15%
   - Significant = -30%
